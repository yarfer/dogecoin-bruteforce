# Dogecoin Brute Forcer w/ fastecdsa

![Imgur](https://img001.prntscr.com/file/img001/JD4EyVVWTcqDZQk6pW81bA.png)

An automated Dogecoin wallet collider that brute forces random wallet addresses.
Original Plutus Brute Forcer created by Isaacdelly. Fastecdsa fork created by imcmurray.
Dogecoin modification done by yarfer.

So the idea for this fork of Plutus is not to attack active wallet addresses (much bad, so despicable), but to attack the dormant ones that has been probably lost forever. Database file has been filled with dormant addresses from 0.3 years. Try your luck on becoming DOGE millionaire (or billionaire).

# Proof Of Concept

Dogecoin private keys allow a person to control the wallet that it correlates to. If the wallet has Dogecoins in it, then the private key will allow the person to spend whatever balance the wallet has. 

This program attempts to brute force Dogecoin private keys in an attempt to successfully find a correlating wallet with a positive balance. In the event that a balance is found, the wallet's private key, public key and wallet address are stored in the text file `much_money.txt` on the user's hard drive.

This program is essentially a brute forcing algorithm. It continuously generates random Dogecoin private keys, converts the private keys into their respective wallet addresses, then checks the balance of the addresses. The ultimate goal is to randomly find a wallet with a balance out of the 2<sup>160</sup> possible wallets in existence.

# How It Works

Private keys are generated randomly to create a 32 byte hexidecimal string using the cryptographically secure `os.urandom()` function.

The private keys are converted into their respective public keys using the `fastecdsa` Python module. Then the public keys are converted into their Dogecoin wallet addresses using the `binascii` and `hashlib` standard libraries.

A pre-calculated database of every P2PKH Dogecoin address with a positive balance is included in this project. The generated address is searched within the database, and if it is found that the address has a balance, then the private key, public key and wallet address are saved to the text file `much_money.txt` on the user's hard drive.

This program also utilizes multiprocessing through the `multiprocessing.Process()` function in order to make concurrent calculations.

# Efficiency

With Fastecdsa the efficieny of this code has increased by an average of 50%, from `0.0032457721` seconds (without Fastecdsa) to `0.0017291287` seconds (with Fastecdsa) for this progam to brute force a __single__ Dogecoin address. 

However, through `multiprocessing.Process()` a concurrent process is created for every CPU your computer has. So this program can brute force addresses at a speed of `0.0017291287 รท cpu_count()` seconds.

Database has been created for dormant addresses. Give yourself a shot on lost wallets to be a DOGE millionaire.

# Expected Output

Every time this program checks the balance of a generated address, it will print the result to the user. If an empty wallet was generated, then the wallet address will be printed to the terminal. An example is:

>D7owrG49zF599RNSwpxQf9tAVGcrqCkuj4

However, if a balance is found, then all necessary information about the wallet will be saved to the text file `much_money.txt`. An example is:

>hex private key: 5A4F3F1CAB44848B2C2C515AE74E9CC487A9982C9DD695810230EA48B1DCEADD<br/>
>public key: 04393B30BC950F358326062FF28D194A5B28751C1FF2562C02CA4DFB2A864DE63280CC140D0D540EA1A5711D1E519C842684F42445C41CB501B7EA00361699C320<br/>
>address: D7owrG49zF599RNSwpxQf9tAVGcrqCkuj4<br/>
>WIF private key: 6KKtnGNVkwg8K9BqygtLjay8b48cfgtWBgv4rSGPMT92sVWvnqH<br/>

# Memory Consumption

This program uses approximately 2GB of RAM per CPU. Becuase this program uses multiprocessing, some data gets shared between threads, making it difficult to accurately measure RAM usage.
